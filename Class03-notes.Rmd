~~~~~Questions to be resolved

-How to upload a project to Git Hub?  Ie if I build the repo on my own computer instead of cloning from GitHub first.
-Should I be getting that other git wrapper thing?
-Can projects be put inside of projects like a folder structure?  Eg building a function to do something as subsection?  Or each class being its own project?

~~~~~Notes and Stuff I did
"watched"" the Discussion Repository on GitHub

workflow seems to be 
do stuff, test its reproducibility, save it, push it somewhere.

within Markdown, can put R code into "chunks" that can be surrounded by text that can be more conversational and are formatted happily for reading.
